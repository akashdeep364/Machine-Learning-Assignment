    "## 1. What is the concept of supervised learning? What is the significance of the name?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning is a method of solving machine learning problems by training a machine learning model using a labelled data. Labelled data would mean that for every nth set of values for i number of independent variables, a value x would be present belonging to the dependent variable where, value of x can belong to countably finite or uncountably infinite set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance of the name is that the name itself explains that there will be some form of supervision working on machine learning. The labelled data acts as a supervision for machine learning as class labels or target variable values have been manually fed or generated from past records."

These surgeries often run a risk of death if a combination of parameters like oxygen saturation level are not within limits. Crucial time is saved by feeding the patient's readings against such parameters into supervised machine learning models that can classify the survivability of a patient post surgery fast."

    "\n",
    "SVM or Support Vector Machine model is a machine learning model that can be used for classification and regression model. It relies on finding a hyperplane and support vectors for classification such that the two data points on the outskirts of their own classes of linearly classifiable data. These support vectors act as margins on either side of the hyperplane. Support vectors are chosen such that the margin on either side of hyperplane is maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine models are not only used for binary linear classification, but can also be used for multiclass non linear classification. Support Vector algorithms use kernels like polynomial kernels, quadratic kernels, string kernels and genome kernels for kernelization which is just like feature transformation."
