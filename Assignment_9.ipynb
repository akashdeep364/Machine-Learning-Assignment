    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of calculating the contribution in terms of information and performance increase to the machine learning model and removing those features that have little to no contribution or are detrimental to the model. Feature selection works by finding irrelevant and redundant features and removing them from the machine learning process. \n",

    " 1. Filter methods\n",
    " Computationally less taxing, filter methods rely on finding the statistics for each feature. Example: Correlation coefficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "The MNIST database consists of 60,000 digits data as training data. Such a high dimensionality data has to be reduced for the machine learning model to be more accurate and take less training time. Dimensionality reduction in the form of feature extraction is done where the features are reduced to a combination of variables that can still describe the same data as before. Non Linear Dimensionality Reduction, Principal Component Analysis method are some of the most widely used techniques."

Even if two similar documents are far apart in terms of distance and frequency of words differ, presence of smaller angles between the vectors of data points make it beneficial for detection of similarity and hence cosine similarity is able to check whether the classifications made are correct or not. Duplication of words in text is important from analysis point of view and is good for measuring this duplication."
